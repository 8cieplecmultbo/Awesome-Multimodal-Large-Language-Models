Eptar Reinforcement is a solution for ArchiCAD that allows you to create and document reinforced concrete structures. With Eptar Reinforcement, you can design and detail beams, columns, walls, slabs, foundations, and other elements with rebar, stirrups, meshes, and labels. You can also generate cutting lists, schedules, and reports with accurate quantities and dimensions.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Eptar Reinforcement for ArchiCAD 16 to create a simple reinforced concrete structure. We will cover the following steps:

## Installing and activating Eptar Reinforcement
 
To use Eptar Reinforcement for ArchiCAD 16, you need to download and install the add-on from the [Eptar website](https://eptar.hu/solutions_downloads?lang=en). You also need to register and activate the add-on with your license key. You can find more details on how to install and activate Eptar Reinforcement in this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPRvPACrGpA).
 
## Creating reinforcement elements
 
Once you have installed and activated Eptar Reinforcement, you can access it from the Design menu in ArchiCAD 16. You will see a new toolbar with different tools for creating reinforcement elements. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to activate the tools.
 
The main tools for creating reinforcement elements are:

- Rebar: This tool allows you to create single or multiple rebars along a polyline or a polygon. You can specify the diameter, spacing, shape, and orientation of the rebars.
- Stirrup: This tool allows you to create stirrups around beams or columns. You can specify the diameter, spacing, shape, and offset of the stirrups.
- Mesh: This tool allows you to create meshes on slabs or walls. You can specify the mesh type, size, spacing, and direction of the meshes.
- Label: This tool allows you to create labels for reinforcement elements. You can specify the label content, style, position, and rotation of the labels.

To create reinforcement elements, you need to select a host element first, such as a beam, column, wall, or slab. Then you can use the appropriate tool to create the reinforcement element on the host element. You can also use the pet palette to modify the reinforcement element after creation.
 
## Editing reinforcement settings
 
You can edit the settings of reinforcement elements by selecting them and opening the settings dialog box. You can access the settings dialog box by double-clicking on the reinforcement element or by clicking on the settings icon in the toolbar.
 
The settings dialog box allows you to change various parameters of reinforcement elements, such as:

- Name: You can assign a name to each reinforcement element for identification purposes.
- Layer: You can assign a layer to each reinforcement element for visibility and filtering purposes.
- Pen & Fill: You can assign a pen color and fill pattern to each reinforcement element for graphical representation purposes.
- Crowning: You can enable or disable crowning for each reinforcement element. Crowning is a feature that allows you to adjust the length of rebars according to bending radiuses.
- ID Listing: You can enable or disable ID listing for each reinforcement element. ID listing is a feature that allows you to assign an ID number to each rebar or mesh segment for documentation purposes.
- Unit & Decimal: You can set the unit and decimal precision for each reinforcement element for calculation purposes.

## Generating documentation
 
After creating and editing reinforcement elements, you can generate documentation for them using Eptar Reinforcement. You can generate different types of documentation, such as:
