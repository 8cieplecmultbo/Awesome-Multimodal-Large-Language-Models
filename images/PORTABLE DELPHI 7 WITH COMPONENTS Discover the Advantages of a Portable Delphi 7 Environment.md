Delphi 7 is a powerful and popular integrated development environment (IDE) for creating Windows applications using the Object Pascal language. However, installing Delphi 7 on multiple computers can be tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, some users may not have the permission to install software on their machines. In this article, we will show you how to create a portable Delphi 7 IDE that can be run from a USB stick or a CD-ROM without requiring installation.

A portable Delphi 7 IDE is a version of Delphi 7 that can be started from any removable media and does not leave any traces on the host computer. It has all of its original functions and can be customized with additional components. To create a portable Delphi 7 IDE, you will need the following:
 
- A valid license for Delphi 7 Personal Edition, which is a free version of Delphi 7 that can be downloaded from [here](http://www.borland.pl/downloads/delphi_7_personal/Delphi7_Personal.zip). You will also need to register at [here](http://www.codegear.com/Downloads/TrialandFreeVersions/Delphi/tabid/138/Default.aspx) to use Delphi 7[^2^].
- A program that can create a portable Delphi 7 IDE, such as Portable Delphi or Delphi Portable. Portable Delphi is an open source project that can be downloaded from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/portabledelphi/). It can also create a BartPE-Plugin, which is a bootable CD-ROM that contains a minimal Windows environment and a portable Delphi 7 IDE[^1^]. Delphi Portable is another program that can create a portable Delphi 7 IDE, but it is not open source and it is only available for the Delphi 7 IDE[^3^].
- A USB stick or a CD-ROM with enough space to store the portable Delphi 7 IDE and the components you want to add.

Once you have these requirements, you can follow these steps to create your portable Delphi 7 IDE:

1. Install Delphi 7 Personal Edition on your computer using the downloaded file. You will need to enter your license key and registration information during the installation process.
2. Run the program that can create a portable Delphi 7 IDE, such as Portable Delphi or Delphi Portable. Choose the option to create a portable Delphi 7 IDE and select the folder where you installed Delphi 7 Personal Edition as the source folder. Then select the destination folder where you want to save the portable Delphi 7 IDE, such as your USB stick or CD-ROM. You can also choose to create a BartPE-Plugin if you want to use a bootable CD-ROM instead of a USB stick.
3. Add any components you want to use with your portable Delphi 7 IDE. You can do this by copying the component files to the appropriate folders in the portable Delphi 7 IDE folder. For example, if you want to add a component called MyComponent.bpl, you can copy it to the Bin folder in the portable Delphi 7 IDE folder. You will also need to edit the registry file in the portable Delphi 7 IDE folder and add an entry for your component under HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Borland\Delphi\7.0\Known Packages. For example, if your component file is called MyComponent.bpl and it is located in the Bin folder, you can add this line: "Bin\MyComponent.bpl"="My Component". You can use any text editor to edit the registry file.
4. Test your portable Delphi 7 IDE by running it from your USB stick or CD-ROM. You should be able to use it as if it was installed on your computer. You can also test your components by creating a new project and adding them to your form.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a portable Delphi 7 IDE with components. You can now use it
