# Kohan II: Kings of War - A Strategy Game for PC
 
Kohan II: Kings of War is a real-time strategy game developed by TimeGate Studios and published by Take-Two Interactive in 2004. It is the sequel to Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns, which was released in 2001. The game is set in a fantasy world where players control one of six factions vying for supremacy in a war-torn land. The game features a unique gameplay system that focuses on managing companies of units rather than individual soldiers, as well as a dynamic campaign that adapts to the player's actions.
 
The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its innovative gameplay mechanics, graphics, sound, and replay value. However, some reviewers criticized its steep learning curve, lack of multiplayer modes, and technical issues. The game sold poorly compared to its predecessor, and no further sequels or expansions were released. The game is still available on Steam for $9.99[^2^], or as part of the Kohan Warchest bundle for $19.99[^2^], which includes the original game and its expansion Kohan: Ahriman's Gift.

The company system is the core gameplay mechanic of Kohan II: Kings of War. Instead of controlling individual units, players create and manage companies of up to six units each. Companies can be customized with different unit types, formations, and support units. Companies have their own morale, experience, and supply levels, which affect their performance in battle. Companies can also be assigned to different tasks, such as scouting, defending, or attacking. The company system allows for more strategic and tactical gameplay, as well as reducing micromanagement.

The dynamic campaign is another feature of Kohan II: Kings of War. The campaign consists of 25 missions that follow the story of the war from different perspectives. The campaign is nonlinear and adaptive, meaning that the player's choices and actions affect the outcome of the war and the events of the next missions. The campaign also features branching paths, optional objectives, and random events that add variety and replay value to the game.
 
Heroes are special units that can lead companies and provide bonuses to their units. Heroes have their own skills, abilities, and equipment that can be upgraded as they gain experience. Heroes can also perform heroic actions, such as rallying troops, casting spells, or dueling enemy heroes. Heroes are essential for winning battles and completing missions, as they can turn the tide of war with their powerful abilities.
