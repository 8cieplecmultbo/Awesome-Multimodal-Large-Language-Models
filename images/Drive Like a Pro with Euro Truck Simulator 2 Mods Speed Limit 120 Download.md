Now that you have installed the Speed Limit Increase mod, you may wonder how it works and what are the benefits of using it. Here are some of the features and advantages of this mod:

- It increases the speed limit for your truck to 120 km/h on most roads, except for some city roads and country roads where the speed limit is lower. This means you can drive faster and reach your destinations sooner.
- It also increases the speed limit for AI traffic to match yours, so you don't have to worry about overtaking or being overtaken by other vehicles. This makes the traffic more realistic and dynamic.
- It does not affect the physics or handling of your truck, so you can still enjoy a realistic driving experience. However, you should be careful and drive safely, as higher speeds also mean higher risks of accidents and fines.
- It is compatible with most maps and DLCs for Euro Truck Simulator 2, so you can use it on any route you like. However, some map mods may have their own speed limits that override this mod.

If you are looking for a simple and effective way to increase the speed limit in Euro Truck Simulator 2, the Speed Limit Increase mod is a good option to try. It will make your driving more fun and challenging, without compromising the realism or quality of the game.
