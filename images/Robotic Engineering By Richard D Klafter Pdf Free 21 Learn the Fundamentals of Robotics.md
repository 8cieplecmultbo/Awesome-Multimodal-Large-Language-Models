## Systems Overview of a Robot
 
A robot is a machine that can sense, plan, and act in a given environment. A robot consists of several components such as sensors, actuators, controllers, computers, and communication devices. A robot can be classified into different types based on its structure, mobility, task, and intelligence.
 
The book introduces the basic concepts and terminology of robotics such as degrees of freedom, workspace, configuration space, manipulability, redundancy, and singularity. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different types of robots such as serial, parallel, hybrid, mobile, humanoid, and swarm robots.
 
## Mechanical Systems: Components, Dynamics and Modeling
 
A mechanical system is the part of a robot that provides the physical structure and motion capabilities. A mechanical system consists of various components such as links, joints, gears, motors, springs, dampers, and friction elements. A mechanical system can be modeled using various methods such as kinematics, dynamics, statics, and energy methods.

The book explains the principles and techniques of modeling mechanical systems using vector algebra, matrix algebra, differential equations, and Lagrange's equations. It also shows how to analyze the performance and stability of mechanical systems using linearization, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and phase portraits.
 
## Control of Actuators in Robotic Mechanisms
 
An actuator is the part of a robot that converts electrical or hydraulic energy into mechanical motion. An actuator can be classified into different types based on its output such as linear or rotary actuators. An actuator can also be classified into different types based on its input such as DC motors, AC motors, stepper motors, servo motors, pneumatic actuators, or hydraulic actuators.
 
The book describes the characteristics and applications of different types of actuators. It also discusses the methods and techniques of controlling actuators using feedback loops, PID controllers, state-space controllers, adaptive controllers, and fuzzy controllers.
