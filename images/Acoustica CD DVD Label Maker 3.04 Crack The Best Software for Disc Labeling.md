## Step 1: Download and install Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker 3.04
 
You can download Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker 3.04 from the official website. You can choose between the full version and the trial version. The full version requires a license key that you can buy online. The trial version is free but has some limitations, such as a watermark on the printed labels and a 15-day expiration date.
 
After downloading the software, run the setup file and follow the instructions to install it on your computer. You may need to restart your computer after the installation is complete.
 
## Step 2: Launch Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker 3.04 and choose a label format
 
After installing the software, launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see a welcome screen that asks you to choose a label format. You can select from various formats, such as CD/DVD disc, jewel case insert, DVD case insert, mini disc, business card disc, and more. For this example, we will choose CD/DVD disc.
 
Click on Next to proceed to the next screen.
 
## Step 3: Choose a template or start from scratch
 
The next screen asks you to choose a template or start from scratch. A template is a pre-designed label that you can customize with your own text and images. Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker 3.04 comes with hundreds of templates for different genres and themes, such as rock, pop, jazz, classical, wedding, birthday, holiday, and more. You can also download more templates from the website or create your own templates and save them for future use.
 
If you want to use a template, you can browse through the categories and select one that suits your needs. You can preview the template on the right side of the screen and see how it looks on a disc. You can also search for a template by keyword or filter by style, color, or rating.
 
If you want to start from scratch, you can click on Start with a blank label and create your own design from scratch. You can add your own background image, text, clipart, shapes, and more.
 
For this example, we will use a template called Rock Band.
 
Click on Next to proceed to the next screen.
 
## Step 4: Customize your label
 
The next screen allows you to customize your label with your own text and images. You can edit the existing elements on the template or add new ones. You can also adjust the size, position, rotation, alignment, color, font, style, and effects of each element.
 
To edit an element, simply click on it and use the toolbar at the top of the screen or the properties panel at the right side of the screen. You can also use the mouse to drag and drop or resize an element.
 
To add an element, click on one of the buttons at the left side of the screen. You can add text boxes, images from your computer or online sources, clipart from various categories, shapes such as circles, squares, stars, etc., barcodes for commercial purposes, and track lists for audio discs.
 
For this example, we will change the band name to "The Rockers", add our own photo as the background image, change the color scheme to blue and white, and add some text effects such as shadow and outline.
 
Click on Next to proceed to the next screen.
 
## Step 5: Print or save your label
 
The final screen allows you to print or save your label. You can print your label directly from the software using any printer that supports label printing. You can also save your label as a PDF file for later printing or sharing online. You can also export your label as an image file in various formats such as JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.
 
To print your label, click on Print Label and choose your printer settings. You can select the paper type and size, orientation, margins, quality, etc. You can also preview your label
