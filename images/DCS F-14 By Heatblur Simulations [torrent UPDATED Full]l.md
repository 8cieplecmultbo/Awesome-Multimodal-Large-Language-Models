DCS: F-14 By Heatblur Simulations is a module for the Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) World that simulates the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, a two-crew, variable wing-geometry, maritime air superiority fighter that served with the US Navy for 32 years and continues to serve with the IRIAF in Iran. The module is the result of several years of research, coding and modelling by Heatblur Simulations, a team of passionate flight simulation developers.
 
The module features both the A and B models of the Tomcat, with the A model following the B later during the Early Access period. The external and internal models of the aircraft are highly detailed and accurate, built using laser scanning and photogrammetry taken of real, museum F-14 Tomcats. The module also includes new models for some of the F-14 Tomcat payloads, such as the AIM-54 Phoenix and the LANTIRN pod.

The flight model of the F-14 Tomcat is based on real performance data and verified by real F-14 pilots. It simulates the complex aerodynamics and physics of the swing-wing configuration, as well as the detailed electrical, hydraulic and fuel systems. The module also features an advanced simulation of the AN/AWG-9 Weapons Control System (WCS) and radar, which allows employment of the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missile and precision ground strikes using laser-guided bombs.
 
One of the most unique features of the module is the cooperative multiplayer functionality that allows one player in the front seat to play as the pilot and one in the back seat to act as the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO). The module also provides two AI options for single-player mode: JESTER AI, a lifelike AI that fills the role of RIO with an interactive interface and a comprehensive library of voice-acted phrases; and ICEMAN AI, a limited-functionality AI that pilots the aircraft when you are in the rear seat acting as the RIO.
 
The F-14 Tomcat is an iconic aircraft that was present in several historic events such as the two Gulf of Sidra incidents, Operations Desert Storm Iraqi Freedom, the Yugoslavian conflict, and Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan. It was also immortalized in the iconic motion picture, Top Gun, and starred in several other feature films. The Heatblur Simulations DCS F-14A/B Tomcat aims to bring this legendary aircraft to life in a high-fidelity simulation that will immerse you in its world.

The F-14 Tomcat has a rich history that spans over four decades of service with the US Navy and the Iranian Air Force. The F-14 was developed as a replacement for the failed F-111B project, which was intended to be a carrier-based version of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark swing-wing fighter-bomber. The F-111B had weight and performance problems and was not suited for the types of aerial combat that were prevalent over Vietnam. [^2^]

The US Navy initiated the Naval Fighter Experimental (VFX) program in the late 1960s to find a new fleet defense interceptor that could counter the Soviet threat of long-range anti-ship missiles launched from jet bombers and submarines. The Grumman Corporation won the competition with its design of a two-seat, twin-engine, variable-sweep wing fighter that incorporated a powerful radar and long-range missiles. The prototype of the F-14, designated YF-14A, first flew on 21 December 1970. [^2^] [^4^]
 
The initial production models of the F-14 were designated F-14A and began to replace the F-4 Phantom II on US Navy carriers in 1974. The F-14A was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 turbofan engines, each generating 20,900 pounds of thrust with afterburning. The F-14A could reach a maximum speed of Mach 2.34 at high altitude and Mach 1.08 at sea level. It had a combat radius of 500 miles (800 km) and a service ceiling of 56,000 feet (17,000 m). The F-14A was armed with a 20-millimeter M61 Vulcan rotary cannon and could carry up to six AIM-54 Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles, four AIM-7 Sparrow medium-range air-to-air missiles, and two AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles. The F-14A also featured an advanced AN/AWG-9 Weapons Control System (WCS) and radar that could track up to 24 targets simultaneously and engage six of them with Phoenix missiles. [^1^] [^2^]
 
The F-14A flew air patrol missions in the final days of the Vietnam War without engaging in combat. In 1981, it shot down two Libyan fighters over the Gulf of Sidra in the first air-to-air kills by an F-14. In 1986, it flew combat air patrol during the US bombing of Libya. In 1991, it participated in Operation Desert Storm over Iraq, where it shot down two Iraqi fighters and performed reconnaissance missions. In 1995, it was modified to carry the LANTIRN targeting pod and laser-guided bombs for precision ground-attack missions over Bosnia. It was nicknamed "Bombcat" for this role. In 1998, it launched cruise missiles against targets in Iraq during Operation Desert Fox. In 2001, it flew combat missions over Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2003, it took part in Operation Iraqi Freedom, where it performed both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles. [^2^] [^3^]
 
The F-14A was followed by several improved variants, such as the F-14A+, which had more powerful General Electric F110 engines and improved avionics; the F-14B, which was a renamed version of the F-14A+; and the F-14D, which had further enhancements such as a new AN/APG-71 radar, a glass cockpit, and additional weapons compatibility. The F-14D was the most advanced and capable variant of the Tomcat, but only 37 were built due to budget constraints. The last F-14 was delivered to the US Navy in 1992. [^2^] [^3^]
 
The F-14 was also exported to Iran under the Shah's regime in 1976, before the Islamic revolution of 1979. Iran received 79 F-14As and about 300 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles, making it the only country other than the US to operate the Tomcat and its unique weapon system. The Iranian F-14s played a vital role in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, where they shot down at least 160 Iraqi aircraft (only 55 confirmed), while losing only seven Tomcats to enemy fire (nine more to accidents).
